We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the AlVatr projects to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the AlVatr projects may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
